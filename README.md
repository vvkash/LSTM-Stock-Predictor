# LSTM-Stock-Predictor
time series model (LSTM) to make prediction using 20-year long historical stock data. Used both train and test data sets along with a wide range of libraries.

Too Use:

donwload these libraries using pip (or pip3):

- pip install pandas_datareader
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install pandas
- pip install tensorflow
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install scikit-learn
- pip install pillow
- pip install yfinance

In this case we will only use the downloaded 20 year stock data, but if you want you can use AlphaVantage (preferred) or Yahoo finance (yFinance) for the stock data using there API. But currently it may not work.

I plan on adding a few more indicators in the future, especially MACD and More specialized oscalators.
